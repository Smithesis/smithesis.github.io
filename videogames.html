            <p>Here are some of my favorite games that I would recommend.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="gameinfo">
            <h2>Sea of Thieves</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite games. You play as a pirate about a ship that you pilot yourself. You sail
                around the map, looking for treasure, and fighting other pirates.
                The gameworld is beutifully designed. Combat can be challenging, but that makes the game even more fun,
                once you get better at the game and get past getting sunk constantly.
            </p>

        <section class="gameinfo">
            <h2>No Man's Sky</h2>
            <p>This game is all about exploring an seemingly infinite universe. There are counless stars systmes to
                explore and each system
                has their own unique planets. Within the game there are counltess activities that you can do such as
                base building, managing a settlement, sending out
                NPC you control on missions, and collecting pets. There is so much to do in the game that you can sink
                hundreds of hours in and not complete everything.
